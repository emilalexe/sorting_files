# sorting_files
Sort large volume of files into specific folders

Case Study:

For example, we have a large volume of files that can be offers and announcements. 
We want to divide them into 2 different folders, OFFERS and ANNOUNCEMENTS.
In each folder we want to work with smaller volumes of files, so we put them in subfolders of 20 files.
For easier management, we want the files to be postmarked with the sorting date (Ex.: file_name-ddmmyyyy.pdf).
