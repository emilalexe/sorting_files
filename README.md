# sorting_files
Sort large volume of files into specific folders<br>
For execution, you need to copy the sort_files.bat file in the folder with all files and execute it.<br>
<br>
<i>Case Study:</i><br>
<br>
For example, we have a large volume of PDF files that can be offers (O*.pdf) and announcements (A*.pdf).<br>
We want to divide them into 2 different folders, <b>OFFERS</b> and <b>ANNOUNCEMENTS</b>.<br>
In each folder we want to work with smaller volumes of files, so we put them in subfolders of 20 files.<br>
For easier management, we want the files to be postmarked with the sorting date (Ex.: file_name-ddmmyyyy.pdf).<br>
